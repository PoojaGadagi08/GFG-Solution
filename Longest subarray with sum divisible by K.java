Given an array containing N integers and a positive integer K, find the length of the longest sub array with sum of the elements divisible by the given value K.

Example 1:

Input:
A[] = {2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5}
K = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:The subarray is {7, 6, 1, 4}
with sum 18, which is divisible by 3.
Example 2:

Input:
A[] = {-2, 2, -5, 12, -11, -1, 7}
K = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
The subarray is {2,-5,12,-11,-1} with
sum -3, which is divisible by 3.
 

Your Task:
The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function longSubarrWthSumDivByK() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), positive integer K, and return the length of the longest subarray which has sum divisible by K. The driver code takes care of the printing.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1<=N,K<=106
-105<=A[i]<=105
 





  class Solution{
    int longSubarrWthSumDivByK(int nums[], int n, int k)
    {
        // Complete the function
        //int n = nums.length;
        int maxLength = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;

        // Create a HashMap to store the remainder of the cumulative sum and its corresponding index
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> remainderMap = new HashMap<>();
        remainderMap.put(0, -1); // Initialize with 0 remainder at index -1

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currentSum += nums[i];

            int currentRemainder = currentSum % k;
            if (currentRemainder < 0) {
                // If currentRemainder becomes negative, convert it to a positive remainder
                currentRemainder += k;
            }

            if (remainderMap.containsKey(currentRemainder)) {
                // If the current remainder is already in the map, update maxLength
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - remainderMap.get(currentRemainder));
            } else {
                // If the current remainder is not in the map, add it with the current index
                remainderMap.put(currentRemainder, i);
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
       
    }
 
}
