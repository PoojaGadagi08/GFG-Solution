Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a star pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *



class Solution {

    void printTriangle(int n) {
        // code herefor
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<=i;j++){
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
