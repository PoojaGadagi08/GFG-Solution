There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
You can reach 4th stair in 5 ways. 
Way 1: Climb 2 stairs at a time. 
Way 2: Climb 1 stair at a time.
Way 3: Climb 2 stairs, then 1 stair
and then 1 stair.
Way 4: Climb 1 stair, then 2 stairs
then 1 stair.
Way 5: Climb 1 stair, then 1 stair and
then 2 stairs.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 10
Output: 89 
Explanation: 
There are 89 ways to reach the 10th stair.
Your Task:
Complete the function countWays() which takes the top stair number m as input parameters and returns the answer % 10^9+7.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 104





  class Solution {
    // Function to count the number of ways to reach the nth stair.
    int countWays(int n) {
        int mod = 1000000007;

        if (n <= 1)
            return 1;

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            // Apply modulo during intermediate calculation
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] % mod + dp[i - 2] % mod) % mod;
        }

        // Apply modulo after updating the dp array to ensure the final result is within range.
        return dp[n];
    }
}
