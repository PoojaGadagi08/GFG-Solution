Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the 
linked list is 5, which is its length.
  
  
  /*
class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int a){  data = a; next = null; }
}*/

class Solution
{
    //Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public static int getCount(Node head)
    {
        
        //Code here
        Node last=head;
        int c=0;
        while(last.next!=null){
            c++;
            last=last.next;
        }
        return c+1;
       
    }
}
